# PeggleBox2D

PeggleBox2D is a clone-game prototype built using the Box2D physics engine and the Qt game development framework.

## Description

The game is inspired by the popular game Peggle, where the player fires a ball to hit and clear pegs on a board. In PeggleBox2D, the player controls a cannon and tries to hit as many targets as possible with a limited number of shots.

The game features the first level, and players can earn points for their accuracy and skill. 

## Features

Some of the key features of PeggleBox2D include:

- Physics-based gameplay using the Box2D engine
- Scoring system based on accuracy and skill
- Power-ups: the game features power-ups that can be collected by hitting specific pegs, such as a multi-ball power-up or a power-up that increases the size of the cannon's shot. These power-ups add an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the gameplay.
